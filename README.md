# Course Overview

* This repository contains my completed coursework, milestones, and final projects for CS-255: Systems Analysis and Design at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

* The course emphasized the system development life cycle (SDLC), requirements gathering, and UML-based modeling to analyze and design software systems that meet client needs. Through the DriverPass Project, I learned how to bridge communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders, transforming client requirements into a functional, scalable system design.

* This work demonstrates my ability to analyze user needs, model processes and objects, and develop detailed documentation that guides developers through implementation and maintenance.

# Portfolio Artifacts
# *Project One: Business Requirements Document (BRD)*

* A comprehensive requirements document outlining the needs of the DriverPass client, who sought a web-based learning platform to help students prepare for DMV driving tests.

* Defines the project’s purpose, goals, and key system components.

* Details functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring clarity for both business and technical teams.

* Includes performance, adaptability, and security standards necessary for system reliability.

# *Project Two: System Design Document (SDD)*

* An in-depth design blueprint expanding on the BRD, providing UML diagrams and technical architecture to guide developers.

* UML Use Case Diagram showing system interactions between students, staff, and external systems.

* Activity Diagrams visualizing workflows for scheduling lessons and taking practice tests.

* Sequence Diagram mapping communication between components for lesson scheduling.

* Class Diagram defining the data structure, relationships, and attributes within DriverPass.

* Describes technical infrastructure, software tools, and security protocols for implementation.

Together, these artifacts demonstrate a complete journey from requirements analysis to system modeling, showcasing my ability to design efficient and user-centered solutions.

# Reflection Journal
# *Project Summary*

The DriverPass Project was designed for a client who wanted to improve driving test success rates by combining online practice exams with in-car training management. The system allows students to register, schedule lessons, take tests, and track progress, while staff and administrators manage scheduling, trainers, and data updates through a secure, cloud-based platform.

# What I Did Well

I particularly excelled at translating business requirements into clear, professional UML diagrams. Each diagram effectively connects user goals to system structure, reflecting both technical depth and business alignment. I also ensured my documentation was visually organized and easy for clients to interpret.

# What I Would Revise

If I could revise one element, I would enhance the Class Diagram by including more system relationships, such as Payment and AuditLog classe,s to strengthen traceability and financial tracking. This would add robustness and support future scalability.

# Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted user needs by reviewing the DriverPass interview transcript and identifying key challenges such as poor preparation rates and lack of scheduling flexibility. These insights directly shaped system functions like progress tracking, lesson scheduling, and automatic DMV updates. Understanding user needs ensures that the final product is intuitive, efficient, and impactful; meeting real-world goals rather than just technical specifications.

# Approach to System Design

My approach follows object-oriented design principles and UML modeling to visualize both static (class structure) and dynamic (behavioral flow) aspects of the system. I prioritize clarity, modularity, and adaptability, creating documentation that can guide both development and future maintenance. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate prototyping and iterative feedback loops to refine designs more collaboratively.

# Reflection and Growth

This course has deepened my understanding of how systems are conceived, modeled, and refined. I’ve learned that clear documentation, consistency, and user-centered thinking are at the heart of successful software design. More importantly, I now see UML not just as a technical tool, but as a communication bridge; turning complex ideas into shared understanding between clients, designers, and developers.

# Tools & Technologies Used

Design Tools: Lucidchart, Microsoft Office Suite

Languages/Concepts: UML, Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

Frameworks: SDLC (System Development Life Cycle)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Documentation Format: Microsoft Word (.docx), PowerPoint (.pptx), PDF

# Portfolio Note

This portfolio highlights my growth as a systems analyst and designer. Through the DriverPass project, I’ve demonstrated my ability to:

* Identify and analyze user and business requirements.

* Create UML diagrams that visualize workflows and object structures.

* Translate real-world challenges into structured, maintainable design solutions.

* Document system logic that supports both developers and stakeholders.

* Together, these projects reflect not only technical proficiency but also my dedication to clarity, collaboration, and thoughtful design.
